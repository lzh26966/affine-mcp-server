## Overview

AFFiNE MCP Server is designed for three common scenarios:
- Run a local stdio MCP server for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, or Claude Desktop
- Expose a remote HTTP MCP endpoint for hosted or browser-connected clients
- Automate AFFiNE workspace, document, database, organization, and comment workflows through a stable MCP tool surface

Highlights:

- Supports AFFiNE Cloud and self-hosted AFFiNE instances
- Supports stdio and HTTP transports
- Supports session-cookie and email/password authentication, plus compatible bearer tokens for older deployments
- Exposes 105 canonical MCP tools backed by AFFiNE GraphQL and WebSocket APIs
- Includes semantic page composition, native template instantiation, database intent composition, capability and fidelity reporting, and workspace blueprint helpers
- Includes Docker images, health probes, and end-to-end test coverage

Scope boundaries:

- This server can access only server-backed AFFiNE workspaces
- Browser-local workspaces stored only in local storage are not available through AFFiNE server APIs
- AFFiNE 0.27+ removed the legacy personal-access-token GraphQL API; this server no longer exposes token-management tools
- AFFiNE Cloud requires browser-session authentication for this external GraphQL integration; programmatic email/password sign-in is blocked by Cloudflare

> New in v3.2.1: Scripted cookie login now keeps session secrets out of process arguments, validates workspace access before saving credentials, and restores document pagination for ordinary workspace members.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm i -g affine-mcp-server
affine-mcp --version
```

You can also run the package ad hoc:

```bash
npx -y -p affine-mcp-server affine-mcp -- --version
```

### 2. Or run the server in Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
  -e AFFINE_BASE_URL=https://your-affine-instance.com \
  -e AFFINE_EMAIL=you@example.com \
  -e AFFINE_PASSWORD=your-password \
  -e AFFINE_MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer \
  -e AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN=your-strong-secret \
  ghcr.io/dawncr0w/affine-mcp-server:latest
```

Then point your client at:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "affine": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-strong-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker, health checks, and remote deployment details, see [docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#docker](docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#docker).

### 3. Save credentials with interactive login

```bash
affine-mcp login
```

This stores credentials in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/affine-mcp/config` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, otherwise in `~/.config/affine-mcp/config`, with mode `600`.

- For AFFiNE Cloud, paste the Cookie request header from a signed-in browser session
- For self-hosted AFFiNE, use email/password (recommended) or a signed-in session cookie
- `AFFINE_API_TOKEN` remains available only for deployments that still accept a compatible GraphQL bearer token

The prompt defaults to `AFFINE_BASE_URL` from the environment or the saved config file, so pressing Enter keeps an already-configured self-hosted URL instead of switching back to AFFiNE Cloud.

For a self-hosted instance reached over plain HTTP on a trusted private network, `AFFINE_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true` must be set for the login run as well as for the server. The opt-in is read from the environment first and then from the saved config file.

To avoid re-running login when a session expires, persist the account credentials instead of the session cookie:

```bash
affine-mcp login --save-credentials
```

With the email/password method, this stores `AFFINE_EMAIL` and `AFFINE_PASSWORD` so the server signs in on its own and renews the session before it expires. The password is written to the mode-`600` config file, so use a dedicated least-privilege AFFiNE account. Without this flag the CLI keeps storing only the session credential, which never renews by itself.

For scripted session-cookie setup, keep the cookie out of process arguments:

```bash
affine-mcp login --url https://app.affine.pro --cookie-stdin --workspace-id your-workspace-id --force
```

Paste the cookie at the hidden prompt, or pipe it from a trusted secret source. The CLI verifies `--workspace-id` against the authenticated account before saving it. Piped input requires `--force` when existing credentials would be replaced.

### 4. Register the server with your client

Claude Code project config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "affine": {
      "command": "affine-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add affine -- affine-mcp
```

More client-specific setup is in [docs/client-setup.md](docs/client-setup.md).

### 5. Verify the connection

```bash
affine-mcp status
affine-mcp doctor
```

If you want to expose the server remotely over HTTP instead of stdio, start with [docs/configuration-and-deployment.md](docs/configuration-and-deployment.md).
If an HTTP server already runs on the same host as your stdio client, use the
private [stdio HTTP bridge](docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#private-stdio-bridge-for-a-local-http-listener)
instead of starting another full server process.

## Compatibility Matrix

Node.js 20.18.1 is the minimum supported runtime. CI validates the Node.js 20, 22, 24, and 26 release lines.

## Tool Surface

`tool-manifest.json` is the source of truth for canonical tool names. The MCP server exposes those tools through `tools/list` and `tools/call`; tool definitions returned by `tools/list` include MCP annotations that mark read-only, destructive, idempotent, and external-world behavior for client-side tool selection.

Every canonical tool also declares an MCP `outputSchema` for its `structuredContent`. Object results retain their existing top-level fields, while array and scalar results use stable `{ items }`, `{ text }`, or `{ value }` envelopes. The existing text `content` remains unchanged for compatibility with clients that do not consume structured results.

Advertised input and output schemas omit the SDK-generated draft-07 `$schema` marker. Schema interpretation follows the client context, allowing clients that reject an explicit draft-07 declaration to consume the tool surface.

Domains:

- Workspace: create, inspect, update, delete, and traverse workspaces
- Organization: collections, collection-rule sync, workspace blueprints, and experimental organize or folder helpers
- Documents: search, read, create, publish, move, tag, custom properties, import/export, semantic composition, template inspection and native instantiation, capability and fidelity reporting, and block-level mutation
- Databases: create columns, add rows, update rows, inspect schema, and compose database structures from intent
- Comments: list, create, update, delete, and resolve
- History: version history listing
- Users and authentication: current user, sign-in, and profile/settings
- Notifications: list and mark notifications as read
- Blob storage: upload, delete, and cleanup blobs

Use `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE=read_only`, `core`, or `authoring` when a deployment should expose a smaller surface than the complete `full` default. This is the recommended path for hosted, browser-connected, or least-privilege deployments because it reduces agent choice overload while keeping the full tool catalog available as an opt-in surface. You can also combine profiles with `AFFINE_DISABLED_GROUPS` such as `docs.database`, `destructive`, or `admin` for finer control.

Full-note replacement with `replace_doc_with_markdown` is destructive and requires `full` without disabling the `destructive` group. `core` and `authoring` retain incremental editing through `append_markdown` and `update_block`.

For the grouped catalog, notes, and operational caveats, see [docs/tool-reference.md](docs/tool-reference.md).

## Verify Your Setup

Useful CLI commands:

- `affine-mcp status` - test the effective configuration
- `affine-mcp status --json` - machine-readable status output
- `affine-mcp doctor` - diagnose config and connectivity issues
- `affine-mcp show-config` - print the effective config with secrets redacted
- `affine-mcp config-path` - print the config file path
- `affine-mcp snippet <claude|cursor|codex|all> [--env]` - generate ready-to-paste client config
- `affine-mcp logout` - remove stored credentials

`status`, `doctor`, and the server runtime use the same `environment > saved config > defaults` resolution. For a self-hosted deployment with a non-standard GraphQL route, use `affine-mcp login --graphql-path /your/graphql/path` or set `AFFINE_GRAPHQL_PATH`; `show-config --json` prints the exact resolved `graphqlEndpoint` without exposing secrets.

For common failures, see:

- [docs/getting-started.md#common-first-run-failures](docs/getting-started.md#common-first-run-failures)
- [docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#deployment-checklist](docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#deployment-checklist)

## Security and Scope

- Never commit passwords, session cookies, or compatible bearer tokens
- Use a dedicated least-privilege AFFiNE account for unattended deployments
- Email/password HTTP sessions share one login and never fall back to anonymous backend requests after authentication failure
- Use HTTPS for non-local deployments
- Keep remote HTTP MCP listeners authenticated; bearer mode refuses a non-loopback bind without `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`
- Send MCP bearer tokens in the `Authorization` header, never in the URL
- Re-run `affine-mcp login` when a saved browser session expires
- Restrict exposed tools with `AFFINE_DISABLED_GROUPS` and `AFFINE_DISABLED_TOOLS` for least-privilege setups
- Treat OAuth mode as a shared AFFiNE service-account deployment: it defaults to `read_only`, and write-capable profiles require `AFFINE_OAUTH_ALLOW_SERVICE_WRITES=true`
- Use `/healthz` and `/readyz` when running the HTTP server behind a container platform or load balancer
- Set HTTP body, session, idle, and shutdown limits explicitly for high-volume deployments

## Development

Run the main quality gates before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run ci
```

Additional validation:

- `npm test` verifies tool metadata, test-suite coverage, and the fast regression suite without requiring a live AFFiNE instance
- `npm run test:comprehensive` boots a local Docker AFFiNE stack and validates the tool surface
- `npm run test:e2e` runs Docker, MCP, and Playwright together
- `npm run test:playwright` runs the Playwright suite only
- Focused runners for the new high-level tool surface include `npm run test:create-placement`, `npm run test:capabilities-fidelity`, `npm run test:native-template`, `npm run test:mutation-ack`, `node tests/test-database-intent.mjs`, `node tests/test-semantic-page-composer.mjs`, `node tests/test-structured-receipts.mjs`, `node tests/test-organize-tools.mjs`, and `node tests/test-supporting-tools.mjs`

Live tests can mutate or delete AFFiNE data. They allow loopback targets by
default and refuse non-loopback targets unless the disposable target is
explicitly enabled and confirmed as documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Never run
them against production.

Local clone flow:

```bash
